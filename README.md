# BNC.2014.query
An interactive R script for a sociolinguistic exploration of the spoken component of the BNC-2014

`BNC.2014.query()` is an interactive R script that I wrote for a course in computational sociolinguistics last semester. It is designed to run queries over the BNC-2014 (spoken component). It extracts a single word or a complex expression, along with speaker information (gender, age class, and social grade), tabulates the results, computes frequencies, and makes a barplot or an association plot (along with a Ï‡2 test).
